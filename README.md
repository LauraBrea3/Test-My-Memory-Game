# Test-My-Memory-Game
This is a quick game in which you can test your memory, the goal is to match two cards at a time by clicking on the different cards until you get a match.  Once all cards on the board are matched the player wins.

The inspiration for this game was my mother, she is always playing games on her phone that stimuate her brain.  I also work with the elderly in my full-time job so I see first hand how important these types of games are to keep our minds sharp.

The game was made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

There is a window prompt once you open the page and which explains how to play.  

I was not able to make the board reset on it's own so instead there is a button that you click and will refresh the page instead.

There is also no prompt to tell you when you have won which is why I inlcuded it in the initial one so that the player knows that once all cards are matched they have won.
